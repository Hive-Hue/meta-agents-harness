mission: Deliver bounded v0.7.0 Expertise Engine evolution for Meta Agents
  Harness, transforming expertise from passive memory into operational routing
  intelligence while preserving policy-first constraints and runtime-agnostic
  contracts.
sprint_mode:
  name: v0.7.0-expertise-engine
  active: true
  target_release: v0.7.0
  objective: "Define and implement bounded v0.7.0 Expertise Engine foundations:
    structured expertise model, expertise-aware delegation, trust/evidence
    signals, and operator-facing registry workflows."
  execution_mode: spec-bound-milestone-driven
  directives:
    - spec-bound execution
    - policy-first routing guardrails
    - no ontology-wave expansion
    - conservative rollout with explicit fallback
    - PR-sized slices
    - mandatory validation at each slice
    - explicit deferred list for anything outside v0.7.0
  must_deliver:
    - Structured expertise schema and validation
    - Expertise catalog, evidence, and metrics persistence
    - Expertise-aware delegation scoring and explain payload
    - Confidence, validation status, and lifecycle transitions
    - Operator-facing expertise CLI surfaces
    - Bounded expertise export and import contracts
    - Integration, contract, and non-regression coverage
  must_not_deliver:
    - full ontology engine
    - automatic trust promotion without evidence or policy
    - unrestricted cross-organization federation
    - implicit permission grants from expertise metadata
    - mandatory dedicated UI dashboard
    - v0.8.0+ scope
sprint_responsibilities:
  - map real codebase integration points for Expertise Engine
  - locate affected files and dependency edges
  - surface regression and coupling risks
  - identify runtime and plugin compatibility constraints
