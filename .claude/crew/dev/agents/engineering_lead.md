team: Engineering
mission: Setup and evolve runtime support, validation, projection, and
  operator-facing architecture for Meta Agents Harness while preserving bounded
  scope and runtime-agnostic design.
sprint_mode:
  name: v0.4.0-runtime-evolution
  active: true
  target_release: v0.4.0
  objective: Finalize the current runtime support roadmap with bounded adapter and
    validation improvements.
  execution_mode: spec-bound-slice-driven
  directives:
    - spec-bound execution
    - no architecture-wave expansion
    - no v0.5.0+ scope
    - PR-sized slices
    - mandatory validation at each slice
    - explicit deferred list for anything outside v0.4.0
  must_deliver:
    - Hermes command and capability discovery
    - runtime compatibility matrix
    - adapter skeleton
    - bounded dispatcher and config integration plan
    - diagnostics and explainability impact plan
    - test plan
    - small implementation-ready slices
  must_not_deliver:
    - full Hermes parity
    - remote execution foundation
    - policy engine
    - federation/interconnect
    - confidential execution
    - runtime contract redesign driven by Hermes
    - MAH becoming Hermes-shaped
sprint_responsibilities:
  - coordinate implementation
  - split work into reviewable changesets
  - preserve adapter and dispatcher boundaries
